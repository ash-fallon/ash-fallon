### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ash from Ireland. I am a Software Developer who specializes in creating mobile-responsive, accessible, web applications. I pride myself on delivering creative and engaging solutions to problems.

The technologies I work with regularly include HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React, TailwindCSS and Git.

When Iâ€™m not on the job, I love hiking and playing video games with my partner, working my way through every recipe I can find, and indulging my love for seeing new places.

If youâ€™d like to learn more about how my services can help your company, please reach out via message on LinkedIn, via email (ash@ashfallon.com) or through the contact form on my portfolio website (ashfallon.com).
